This repo adds (experimental/alpha) Netty support to Ring

(use 'ring.adapter.netty)
(defn app
  [req]
  {:status  200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body    (str "hello word")})

(run-netty app {:port 8080})

Currently there are 2 branches: master (clojure 1.1) and compat-1.2 for clojure 1.2 support.  The only difference is proxy vs reify (reify performs better).

I'm getting roughly 7k req/s with 1.1 and 9.5k req/s with 1.2 using an unscientific benchmark on my not-quite-so-new machine.


Next steps: 
1. squash any bugs that pop up
2. ssl support
3. websockets, comet
